    <p id="band-history">
    <strong><i>The Monkees</i></strong> are an American rock and pop band (1966-1971)
    formed in Los Angeles in 1965 for the American TV series "The Monkees" (1966-1968).
    The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans <a href="#bio-md"><i>Micky Dolenz</i></a>, <a href="#bio-mn"><i>Michael Nesmith</i></a>, 
    and <a href="#bio-pt"><i>Peter Tork</i></a>; and British actor and singer <a href="#bio-dj"><i>Davy Jones</i></a>.<br> 
    The four actor-musicians were allowed only limited roles in the recording studio for
    the first few months of their five-year career as "the Monkees". This was due in part
    to the amount of time required to film the television series. 
    <img src="images/cover3.jpg" alt="members picture" id="cover3">
    Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some songs from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited
    guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. They eventually fought for the right to
    collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. The television show was
    canceled in 1968, but the band continued to record music through 1971.<br>
    A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of reunion 
    tours and new records. The group has reunited and toured several times since then with different
    line-ups and varying degrees of success.
    After Davy Jones died on February 29, 2012, the surviving members reunited for a tour in 
    November–December 2012 and again in 2013 for a 24-date tour. The Monkees continued
    to tour through their 2016 50th Anniversary, with Dolenz and Tork forming the core of the
    band and Nesmith continuing to join them occasionally.Dolenz described The Monkees as initially
    being "a TV show about an imaginary band… that wanted to be the Beatles that was never successful".
     Ironically, the actor-musicians became one of the most successful bands of the 1960s. 
    The Monkees have sold more than 75 million records worldwide making them one of the
    biggest selling groups of all time with international hits, including "Last Train to Clarksville", 
    "Pleasant Valley Sunday", "Daydream Believer", and "I'm a Believer". Newspapers and magazines reported 
    that the Monkees outsold the Beatles and the Rolling Stones combined in 1967, but Nesmith claims 
    in his autobiography Infinite Tuesday that it was a lie that he told an Australian reporter.<br>
