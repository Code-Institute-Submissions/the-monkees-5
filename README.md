## Testing
Testing tools used to verify codes:
* W3C CSS Validation Service(https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
* W3C Markup Validation Service (https://validator.w3.org/)
* Chrome DevTools (life saver)

The website has been testing by myself and other parties on various devices, screen sizes and browsers:
<dl>
 <dt>Android</dt>
 <dl>Samsung Galaxy A3
 <dl>Samsung Galaxy J5
 <dl>Samsung Galaxy TAB A
 <dt>IOS</dt>
 <dl>Iphone 5s
 <dl>Iphone 6
 <dl>Macbook
 <dt>Browsers</dt>
 <dl>Google Chrome (Version 69.0.3497.100)
 <dl>Firefox (62.0.3)
 <dl>Explorer (42.17134.1.0)
</dl>

#### Differences depending on screen sizes
> All features have been tested and functionned in all these platforms. 
The layouts have also been checked in portrait and landscape.
* The advert for ordering new Greatest Hits in Home page display the album cover 
in small to large devices but doesn't in mobile format.
* The footer gets simplified in mobile format
* Realingment of members cards in History file to suit screen size
* Realingment of music and videos in Listen page to suit screen size


> The ordering forms have been set as "required"; a message does appear in case of some information missing: 
[screenshot](the-monkees/images.form-incomplete.png) of ordering form in home page.

> Having a display and a layout that suits all screens has definitely been the 
biggest challenge; __DevTools__ has been the greates tool during the project.

##### Issue
> The fixed backgroung in the Events page is scrolling in some mobile device.(fixing still in progress)
